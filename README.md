# Enhanced_Lux_VehControl

I did not make the original script, I simply modifed them. All original credits go to Lt.Caine for his Luxart Vehicle Control and London Studios for the server sided siren script.

I adapted Lux_VehControl to work with the server sided script that is provided in the file nad I added a fourth siren option to the script.


How to intall?

Unzip the package
Create a directory in your resources named [siren]
Drag and drop both files into the directory
Start the resources in your server.cfg
Restart your server and you are good to go!
